        <h2 class="section-title">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>¼ cup almond milk (substituted for heavy cream, half-and-half, or whole milk)</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded cheese, like Gruyere, cheddar, fontina, goat cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups filling cut into small pieces, like bacon (cut into pieces) or chorizo; asparagus, zucchini, or thinly sliced onions or potatoes; even greens like baby spinach or baby kale</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>2-3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
            <li>Handful of fresh herbs, like mint, thyme, or green onions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 400°F.</li>
            <li>Combine the eggs, almond milk, and ½ tsp salt into a large bowl, and beat until frothy.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, then add your filling. Cook meats first, removing from pan before cooking any additional vegetables and garlic in the delicious fat. Combine all fillings together before sprinkling cheese over the top.</li>
            <li>Pour egg mixture on top of filling and cheese; tilt pan gently until eggs cover all the filling.</li>
            <li>Bring heat down to medium, and allow to cook until eggs are just beginning to set at the edge, 4-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Working carefully, transfer pan to oven and let cook another 5-8 minutes, until the custard is set and the top is golden brown and crispy.</li>
            <li>Let frittata cool in the pan for 2 minutes before slicing into wedges. Leftovers can be kept in the refrigerator in a sealed container for a week.</li>
        </ol>
