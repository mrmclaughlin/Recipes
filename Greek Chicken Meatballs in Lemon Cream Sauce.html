            <li>1 ¼ pound lean ground chicken</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Lemon Olive Sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons salted cold butter, cubed</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups low sodium chicken stock</li>
            <li>½ cup green olives (or use ¼ cup capers!)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest + ⅓ cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>MEATBALLS:</strong> In a medium bowl, using a fork, mix together all the ingredients except the ground chicken. Add 1 teaspoon of salt and ½ teaspoon of pepper. When combined, add the ground chicken and mix until *just* combined. Roll into 24-28 meatballs using a cookie scoop or about 1 ½ tablespoon each.</li>
            <li><strong>COOK:</strong> Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drizzle in a little oil. Add the meatballs to the skillet but do not overcrowd. Cook in batches if needed. Sear the meatballs for 5-7 minutes, flipping to brown all sides evenly, until cooked through. Remove to a plate.</li>
            <li><strong>SAUCE:</strong> Add 2 tablespoons butter to the skillet with the minced garlic for 30 seconds, stirring. Add the flour and whisk. Slowly drizzle in the chicken broth, then simmer for 3 minutes until thickened. Lower the heat. Whisk together the lemon juice and egg yolks, then gradually mix in a bit of the sauce. Add this mixture back to the skillet. Cook for 4-6 minutes until thickened. Stir in the nutmeg and lemon zest. Adjust seasoning. Add the last tablespoon of butter, the green olives, and meatballs back to the skillet. Warm through.</li>
            <li>Serve with fried bread, over buttered orzo, or rice!</li>
