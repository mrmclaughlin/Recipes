    <p class="description">With layers of cheese, tomato sauce and vegetables, this EASY vegetarian lasagna will soon become a favorite in your house. Low-carb and gluten-free, it is simply prepared with zucchini noodles.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4–5 medium zucchinis, thinly sliced lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>½ yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 cups (650g) tomato sauce*</li>
        <li>2 cups (450g) mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
        <li>1 ½ cup (375g) ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons parmesan cheese, grated + extra for topping</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2–3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons fresh basil leaves, chopped + extra for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>For the zucchini. Slice the zucchini lengthwise, into thin layers, using a knife or a mandoline slicer. Arrange them onto the prepared baking sheet and brush lightly with olive oil on one side. Pre-bake for about 10 mins, turning them once halfway through cooking. The zucchini slices must be softened but not too greasy – pat-dry with paper towel to remove the excess of oil if needed. Set aside.</li>
        <li>For the tomato sauce. Heat up one Tablespoon olive oil in a skillet placed over medium heat. Add the onions and sauté until soft and translucent. Pour in the tomato sauce and adjust seasoning to your liking if needed.</li>
        <li>For the ricotta filling. In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese with parmesan, egg, minced garlic, and about 3 Tablespoons chopped basil leaves. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>For assembling the lasagna. Grease a large 13×9" baking dish (33×23 cm) with olive oil. Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce at the bottom of the dish, then layer the zucchini sliced, add spoonfuls of the ricotta mixture, sprinkle grated mozzarella, pour some tomato sauce, and repeat each step until finished. On top, layer with tomato sauce, grated mozzarella and the extra grated parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 30 minutes, and broil on high for a few extra minutes, monitoring the oven closely to ensure the top is browned but not burned. Sprinkle with additional fresh basil leaves, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="notes">* You can use basic tomato sauce, marinara sauce, or use homemade tomato sauce.</p>
