        <p class="time">Servings: 4 to 6 | Prep Time: 35 Minutes | Cook Time: 15 Minutes | Total Time: 50 Minutes, plus at least 8 hours to marinate</p>
        
        <h2 class="section-title">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup plain whole milk Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cumin</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (reduce to ½ teaspoon for less heat)</li>
            <li>Zest from one lemon</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, from one lemon</li>
            <li>1¾ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>5 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>2½ to 3 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat and cut into 1½-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 large red onion, cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil, for greasing the grill</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the yogurt, olive oil, paprika, cumin, cinnamon, red pepper flakes, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and garlic.</li>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil for easy clean up. Thread the chicken onto metal skewers, alternating with the red onions. Place the kabobs on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the marinade all over the meat, coating well. Cover and refrigerate at least eight hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Grease the grill grates with vegetable oil. Grill the chicken kabobs until golden brown and cooked through, turning occasionally, 13 to 15 minutes. Transfer the kabobs to a platter and serve.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Boneless skinless chicken thighs are recommended for juicier and more flavorful results, and they work better in this type of yogurt and lemon-based marinade.</p>
