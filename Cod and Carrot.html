        <h2 class="section-title">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 oz. Cod</li>
            <li>8 oz. Carrot</li>
            <li>1 Lemon</li>

            <li>1 oz. Butter</li>
            <li>1 oz. Roasted Sliced Almonds</li>
            <li>¼ oz. Parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong> Peel, trim, and quarter carrot. Cut into small pieces. Halve lemon lengthwise. Cut one half into two wedges and juice the other half. Stem and mince parsley. Pat cod dry, and season both sides with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Wild Rice Pilaf:</strong> Place a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add 1 tsp. olive oil and carrot to hot pot and stir occasionally until carrot begins to soften, 2-4 minutes. Add 1 cup water and rice and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until rice is tender, 20-22 minutes. Set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Cod:</strong> Place a medium non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add 2 tsp. olive oil and cod to hot pan and cook undisturbed until lightly browned, 2-3 minutes. Transfer cod to prepared baking sheet, seared side up, and roast until fish reaches a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees, 5-9 minutes. Wipe pan clean and reserve.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the Brown Butter Almonds:</strong> Return pan used to sear cod to medium heat. Add butter and cook until it browns and begins to smell nutty, 1 minute. Stir in almonds and cook until golden brown, 30-60 seconds. Remove from burner and add lemon juice, 2 Tbsp. water, and half the parsley (reserve remaining for garnish).</li>
            <li><strong>Finish the Dish:</strong> Plate dish as pictured, garnishing with remaining parsley and lemon wedges. Bon appétit!</li>
