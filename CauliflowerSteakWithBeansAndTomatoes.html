        <h1 class="recipe-title">Cauliflower Steak with Beans & Tomatoes</h1>
        <p class="description">This creamy cauliflower steak goes down like a rich, Italian pasta dish, and everyone in our test kitchen raved about it. The cauliflower absorbs all the garlicky, lemony, herby flavor of the bread-crumb coating, and the edges char in the oven while the inside remains tender and juicy.</p>
        <p class="description">The tangy mayo adds just enough fat to anchor and balance the dish, and the white bean-tomato mixture packs a flavorful punch. Put all these components together and the dish tastes like it has something briney in it — in the best way.</p>
        <p class="description">Last but not least, we love cauliflower as a base for plant-based mains, but we’re often disappointed when vegetarian recipes like this one come up short on the actual veggie part of the equation. The green beans solve that problem and they add a squeaky, delicious crunch. This meal is a true textural treat.</p>
        <p class="description">With the cauliflower, beans, and tomatoes, this dish feels like a true main + side situation, and we’re here for it.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>1 large head of cauliflower (about 2 pounds)</li>
                <li>½ cup extra virgin olive oil, divided</li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>

                <li>8 ounces green beans, trimmed</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
                <li>¾ teaspoon lemon zest</li>
                <li>⅓ cup chopped parsley, plus more for garnish</li>
                <li>⅓ cup panko</li>
                <li>¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan</li>
                <li>1 15-ounce can white beans, drained and rinsed</li>
                <li>1 cup halved golden or red cherry tomatoes (about 6 ounces)</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-title">Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Arrange racks in middle and upper third of oven; heat to 425 F.</li>
                
                <li>Remove leaves and trim the stem end of cauliflower, leaving the core intact. Place the cauliflower core side down on a work surface. Using a large knife, slice through the center from top to bottom to yield 2 1-inch “steaks”; reserve the remaining cauliflower ends for another use.</li>
                
                <li>Place cauliflower steaks on a rimmed baking sheet and, using 1 tablespoon olive oil, brush both sides of the steaks. Season with ¼ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Roast on the lower rack of the oven, turning halfway through, until cauliflower is tender and browned, about 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
                
                <li>Meanwhile, on a second rimmed baking sheet, toss green beans with 1 tablespoon olive oil, ¼ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Arrange in a single layer, then roast on the top rack of the oven until green beans begin to blister, about 15 minutes.</li>
                
                <li>Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together garlic, lemon zest, ⅓ cup parsley, remaining 6 tablespoons olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper until thoroughly mixed. Transfer half of the mixture to a second medium bowl.</li>
                
                <li>To the first bowl, add the panko and Parmesan, and stir until fully combined. Set aside.</li>
                
                <li>To the second bowl, add the white beans and tomatoes, and toss to coat. Set aside.</li>
                
                <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise and mustard.</li>
                
                <li>Remove sheet pans from oven. Spread mayonnaise mixture over the cooked cauliflower. Sprinkle ¼ cup panko mixture evenly over cauliflower. Spread the remaining panko mixture evenly on the sheet pan.</li>
                
                <li>Add the white bean mixture to the sheet pan with green beans and toss to combine. Return both sheet pans to the oven and continue to roast until the panko topping starts to brown and the white beans begin to crisp, 5 to 7 minutes more.</li>
                
                <li>Divide cauliflower steaks between two plates and top with bean-tomato mixture and toasted panko. Garnish with parsley and enjoy immediately.</li>
