            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Butter, for greasing</li>
                <li>175g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
                <li>75g wholemeal self-raising flour</li>
                <li>1/2 tbsp flaked sea salt, e.g. Maldon</li>
                <li>250ml beer or lager</li>
                <li>1–2 tbsp milk</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Method</h2>
            <p>Makes 8 mini loaves</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 180ºC/Gas 4. Grease 8 mini loaf tins (4.5 x 7.5 x 3cm), then dust with flour and shake out any excess.</li>
                <li>Sift the flours into a mixing bowl and add the salt. Pour in the beer, mixing as you do so, until the mixture is free of lumps. The batter will appear unusually runny for a bread mix.</li>
                <li>Divide the batter between the prepared tins, filling them three-quarters full, place on a baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes. Brush the tops with a little milk and a light dusting of flour (to help the tops color nicely) and bake for a further 5 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle of the loaf comes out clean, and the bottom sounds hollow when tapped.</li>
                <li>Remove the loaves from the tins and cool on a wire rack. They can be eaten warm or cold, and will keep for a couple of days in an airtight container.</li>
            </ol>
