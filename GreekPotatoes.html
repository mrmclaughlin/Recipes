            <ol>
                <li>Grease a large baking pan (at least 9 x 13 inch) with olive oil and preheat the oven to 400F (200C).</li>
                
                <li>Cut the peeled potatoes into wedges roughly 2-3 cm thick. Put them into the baking pan in an even layer. A few can be overlapping but don't overcrowd the pan.</li>
                
                <li>Combine the garlic, lemon juice, broth/stock, olive oil, oregano, and salt and pepper. Stir well, then pour evenly over the potatoes.</li>
                
                <li>Bake uncovered for around 40 minutes.</li>
                
                <li>Then stir well, turning all the potatoes and spooning over the liquid. If using a fan oven, turn down to 355F (180C). Bake again for another 20 to 30 minutes or until the potatoes are well browned, crisp in parts and tender inside. Keep an eye on them during the second half of cooking as you want them to be crispy but of course not burned.</li>
                
                <li>Scatter with fresh parsley (if using) before serving. Don’t forget to serve with some of the delicious juices, as well as the super crispy bits on the bottom of the pan!</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 class="section-title">Notes</h2>
            <p>Type of potatoes to use: Waxy potatoes such as Yukon Golds, red potatoes, or fingerling are best since they hold together well while cooking and taste beautifully creamy inside.</p>
            <p>However... I have made Greek lemon potatoes with literally EVERY type of potato! They always taste delicious!</p>
            <p>How to serve: These go with almost anything as a delicious side. Serve with Greek chicken meatballs (or regular meatballs), easy baked chicken thighs (or any kind of meat), fish (try this amazing Greek baked fish), or a vegetarian option like baked eggplant.</p>
            <p>A big bowl of Greek tsatziki sauce and a Greek village salad also go incredibly well on the side!</p>
            <p>Preparing ahead: I sometimes cut into wedges, pour the marinade over, then cover and keep in the fridge until I'm ready to cook them. You can do this up to a day ahead.</p>
            <p>A note about the cooking time: Since I've been making these for years, I've realized that the perfect cooking time varies a little depending on the oven. They generally take 60 to 80 minutes to cook perfectly - possibly a little longer in an oven that isn't a fan oven. Just keep a close eye on them after the 1 hour mark. The potatoes should be very crispy and browned but of course not burned. There should still be some liquid left in the pan.</p>
            <p>If they look like they're browning too much but aren't yet tender enough inside, simply tuck some aluminum foil over the top for the last part of cooking. You can also turn the oven down a little.</p>
            <p>This authentic Greek-style potatoes recipe is definitely worth persevering with in your particular oven to get them absolutely perfect every time!</p>
            <p>How to reheat: The potatoes taste just as wonderful reheated the next day! You can either reheat a whole pan (try 350F/175C for 15 to 20 minutes in the oven) or reheat smaller amounts in the microwave for 1 to 2 minutes. They won't be as crisp when reheated in the microwave, but they'll still taste extremely delicious!</p>
