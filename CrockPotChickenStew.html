        <h2 class="section-title">Equipment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Crock Pot (this one is big enough for the full stew)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium sweet onions, chopped into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>3 stalks celery, chopped</li>
            <li>4 medium carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>2 medium russet potatoes, peeled and chopped into small bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>2 small cloves garlic, minced or pressed (about 1 teaspoon)</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme (or about 1 teaspoon dried thyme)</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary (or about 1 teaspoon dried rosemary)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
            <li>3-4 lbs. bone-in chicken breasts or thighs, skin removed</li>
            <li>3 cups low-sodium chicken broth or chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch + 1 tablespoon cold water (or increase to 2 tablespoons of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons cold water for a slightly thicker broth)</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place onions, celery, carrots, potatoes, garlic, bay leaf, 1 teaspoon salt, thyme, rosemary, paprika, and poultry seasoning in the bottom of a large slow cooker. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Season the chicken with salt and pepper, to taste. Place the chicken on top of vegetables.</li>
            <li>Pour chicken broth over everything, cover, and cook on LOW for 6-8 hours or on HIGH for 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>When there are about 30 minutes left in the cooking time, remove the chicken from the slow cooker and chop or shred the meat. Return chicken meat to the slow cooker and discard bones. Discard bay leaf and herb stems (if using fresh herbs).</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and cold water until smooth. Stir the cornstarch slurry into the stew and cook on HIGH without the lid for 30 minutes (or until broth thickens a little bit). Taste and season with additional salt and pepper, if desired. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley, just before serving.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="section-title">Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Every slow cooker runs at a slightly different temperature (which is why the recipe gives you general time ranges, rather than exact times). Since my slow cooker tends to cook at a relatively high temperature, I find that the meal is best when cooked on HIGH for about 3 hours or on LOW for about 6 hours. Just get familiar with your pot and adjust accordingly.</li>
            <li>Use a pair of kitchen shears to quickly and easily remove the skin from the chicken breasts.</li>
            <li>I use bone-in chicken breasts or bone-in thighs for a couple of reasons. The bone-in meat has a longer cooking time than a boneless, skinless chicken breast or thigh, so the meat stays juicy and tender while the carrots and potatoes finish cooking. The bones also give the broth tons of added flavor. However, if you can't find them or if you don't want to bother with them, then boneless thighs or breasts will also work.</li>
            <li>The total amount of salt necessary will vary, depending on the saltiness of your broth and on your own personal taste preferences. Season as you go, and add extra if desired.</li>
        </ul>
