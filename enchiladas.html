    <h2 class="section-title">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 lb Chicken</li>
        <li>1 cup Chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Pepper</li>
        <li>1 can Black beans</li>
        <li>2 cups Shredded cheese</li>
        <li>Corn tortillas</li>
        <li>Enchilada sauce (<a href="https://mrmclaughlin.github.io/Recipes/EnchiladaSauce.html">Recipe here</a>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C).</li>
        <li>In a pot, combine the chicken, cumin, chili powder, and chicken broth. Cook on medium heat until it reaches a slow boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165째F (75째C) and shreds easily. Shred the chicken.</li>
        <li>In another pot, cook the black beans with a little water over medium heat until soft.</li>
        <li>Wrap a stack of corn tortillas in damp paper towels or a damp kitchen towel, then wrap in plastic wrap or place in a microwave-safe resealable plastic bag (keep the bag open to vent). Microwave until warm and flexible, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Spread a ladle of enchilada sauce in a 9x12-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Divide the shredded chicken among half of the tortillas and the black beans among the other half. Add shredded cheese to each.</li>
        <li>Roll up the tortillas and place them in the baking dish. Use a bit of enchilada sauce to hold them together if needed.</li>
        <li>Cover the enchiladas with the remaining enchilada sauce and sprinkle with more shredded cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes, or until the edges are crispy and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Serve with rice and a salad.</li>
    </ol>
<h2 class="section-title">Notes</h2>
<p>It is safer to make more Enchilada sauce than needed so make 4 cups at least. It is great to add the sauce to reheat the Enchiladas. You may also modify to just make beans or chicken instead of both</p>
