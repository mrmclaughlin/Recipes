    <h2 class="section-title">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable or olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 red onion, sliced</li>
        <li>2 pound chuck roast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>3 large russet potatoes, peeled and sliced into 1-inch wedges</li>
        <li>5 large carrots, peeled and sliced into 1-inch thick pieces</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375째F (190째C).</li>
        <li>Put your Dutch oven on the stove and heat it over high heat for about 5 minutes to sear the meat. Add the oil and season the meat with salt and pepper on both sides. Add it to the pan. It should sizzle immediately.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium-high and let the meat sear on one side for 5 minutes, then flip. Add the onions and cook for 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Add the beef broth to the pot--it should come about halfway up the side of the meat.</li>
        <li>Cover and bake for an hour and a half, then check the liquid in the pot. Add a cup or so of extra water if needed.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to 350째F (175째C) and bake for an additional hour. Then add the carrots and potatoes. Bake covered for 45 minutes longer or until the meat is tender and the potatoes and carrots are soft.</li>
    </ol>
