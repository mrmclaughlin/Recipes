    <p class="servings">Servings: 6 servings</p>
    <p class="time">Prep: 15 minutes | Cook: 35 minutes | Ready in: 50 minutes</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Food processor (I use and recommend Cuisinart's food processors).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
        <li>2 (14.5 oz) cans low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 (7 oz) can diced green chilies</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 (8 oz) pkg Neufchatel cheese (aka light cream cheese), cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup frozen or fresh corn</li>
        <li>2 (15 oz) cans cannellini beans</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups shredded cooked rotisserie or leftover chicken*</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>Tortilla chips or strips, monterey jack cheese, sliced avocado for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté for 4 minutes. Add garlic and sauté for 30 seconds longer.</li>
        <li>Add chicken broth, green chilies, cumin, paprika, oregano, coriander, cayenne pepper, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring mixture just to a boil then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain and rinse beans in a fine mesh strainer or colander then measure out 1 cup. Set whole beans aside, transfer 1 cup beans to a food processor along with 1/4 cup broth from soup, puree until nearly smooth**.</li>
        <li>Add Neufchatel cheese to soup along with corn, whole beans, and pureed beans and stir well. Simmer for 5 - 10 minutes longer.</li>
        <li>Stir in chicken, fresh lime juice, and cilantro. Serve with Monterey Jack cheese, more cilantro, avocado slices, and tortilla chips if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="notes">*Recipe updated to use pre-cooked shredded chicken (previously used 1 lb raw chicken in this recipe and cooked at the beginning). I like the flavor of rotisserie chicken better plus this way you don't end with over-cooked chicken breasts.</p>
    <p class="notes">**If you don't own a food processor you can skip the pureeing step, soup just won't be quite as creamy.</p>
