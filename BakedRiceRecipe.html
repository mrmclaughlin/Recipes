            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup long grain rice</li>
                <li>1 ¾ cup water - Boiling</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375°F conventional or 350°F convection.</li>
                <li>Add butter and Kosher salt to boiling water in an oven-safe pan—stir well, then mix in white long-grain rice. Use a 2-quart casserole dish, a 6X9 inch baking dish, or an 8 to 9 inch round baking pan.</li>
                <li>Tightly cover with a piece of aluminum foil. Bake for 25 minutes until the rice is tender but not mushy, and all the liquid should be absorbed. If it's not done, bake for another 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Fluff it with a fork to let the steam out, and serve. If you don't fluff, the rice may continue to cook and become mushy.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>NOTES: Delay cook. put everything in oven as before but leave oven off. Set on timmer and start temp at 425. Once oven preheats let cook for 2 min then drop temp to 375 and cook for 20min</p>
