                <li>1 wide mouth glass jar (1 gallon or more)</li>
                <li>1 Cloth and rubber band</li>
                <li>4 Pressure-resistant bottles</li>

        <h2 class="ingredients-title">INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>10 cups filtered water</li>
            <li>1 jun scoby and its liquid starter (about 1Â½ cup)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. tea</li>
            <li>1 cup honey</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="steps-title">STEPS</h2>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li><strong>Preparation</strong></li>
            <li>Place the tea bag in the jar.</li>
            <li>Pour 500 ml of boiling water and let infuse for 15 minutes. Remove the tea bag.</li>
            <li>Add the honey and stir until it's dissolved.</li>
            <li>Add the rest of the cold water, until you get 3 litres.</li>
            <li>Add the jun scoby with its liquid culture.</li>
            <li>Cover the container with the cloth and the rubber band.</li>
            <li><strong>Fermentation</strong></li>
            <li>Let it ferment for 5 to 12 days at room temperature, away from direct sunlight.</li>
            <li>As of day 5, taste once a day. As soon as the acidity is to your liking, it is time to bottle.</li>
            <li>Set aside the scoby along with some jun (about 500 ml) for your next recipe. Store in the fridge.</li>
            <li><strong>Bottling</strong></li>
            <li>Transfer the jun into pressure resistant bottles. Fill to within 5 cm of the rim and close tightly.</li>
            <li>If you want a fizzier jun, let the bottles ferment at room temperature for 2 to 4 days.</li>
            <li>Put in the fridge as soon as the jun is fizzy (be careful with the pressure).</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="recipe-notes"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
        <ul class="notes">
            <li>Important! Don't forget a room temperature bottle, as the pressure continues to build up day after day. You risk painting your ceiling, or worse, exploding your bottle.</li>
            <li>Jun can be stored in the fridge for several months.</li>
