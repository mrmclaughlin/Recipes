        <p class="recipe-description">Classic falafels get a healthy spring update in our Crispy Baked Lemon Chickpea Cakes. Instead of frying, we use an oven-baked method that makes them crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. We pack them full of lemon zest, lemon juice, sweet leeks and dijon mustard for a zippy kick. Perfect on top of a salad or served on their own with a touch of greek yogurt.</p>

        <h2 class="ingredients-title">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 leek halved and sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>2 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup pine nuts</li>
            <li>15 oz can chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 tsp lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tbsp dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1/4 cup plain breadcrumbs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="instructions-title">Instructions</h2>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>Heat a small non-stick skillet to medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil. Add leeks and ¼ teaspoon salt, and garlic. Sauté until leeks have softened, about 3-4 minutes. You don't want them to brown, so if they start to crisp up, turn the heat down to medium-low. Once they've softened, add garlic. Cook another minute. Transfer leeks and garlic to a large bowl and cool.</li>
            <li>Wipe the pan clean and toast pine nuts over a medium-low flame. They are done when they smell nutty, be careful not to burn. Transfer to the bowl with the leeks and garlic.</li>
            <li>Add chickpeas to the bottom of a food processor, pulse until the chickpeas are in tiny pieces, but not pureed. They should look a little bigger than grains of sand, with some bigger pieces as well; you still want a bit of texture. Transfer chickpeas to the bowl with the leeks, garlic, and pine nuts.</li>
            <li>Add egg, lemon zest, juice, Dijon, breadcrumbs, and remaining salt. Toss until combined. Use a small ice cream scoop or 1/4 cup measure to portion out 7-8 fritters. Rinse hands with a little bit of cold water and form into compact patties.</li>
            <li>Heat the same skillet you cooked the leeks in to medium heat. Add the remaining two tablespoons of olive oil. When the oil is hot, swirl the pan to coat. Add chickpea cakes and cook until crisp and brown, about 3-4 minutes. Flip and cook another 2-3 minutes until crisp and brown on the other side. Serve with yogurt sauce.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="sauce-title">Yogurt Sauce</h2>
        <ol class="sauce-instructions">
            <li>Add all ingredients to a small bowl, mix to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
