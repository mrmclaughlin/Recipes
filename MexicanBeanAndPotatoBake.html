            <li>3 fairly large potatoes, cut into bitesize pieces</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon oil</li>
            <li>1 bell pepper (I used red), cut into bitesize pieces</li>
            <li>~ 8 medium mushrooms, quartered</li>
            <li>1 medium courgette (zucchini), cut into bitesize pieces</li>
            <li>400 g tin kidney beans, drained (240g, or ~ 1 ¼ cups, when drained)</li>
            <li>400 g tin chopped tomatoes (~ 1 ⅓ cups)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon hot chilli powder</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>75 g cheddar cheese, grated (~ ¾ cup when grated)</li>
            <li>Fresh coriander (cilantro), to serve (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Toss the diced potatoes in a dash of oil, and spread them out in a large casserole dish or baking dish. Roast at 190°C (Gas Mark 5 / 375°F) for around 45 minutes, tossing halfway, or until mostly cooked and starting to crisp up.</li>
            <li>Add all of the vegetables to the dish, along with the kidney beans, tinned tomatoes, and spices. Season generously, and mix to combine. Return to the oven for a further 30 minutes, until the vegetables are soft and the tomatoes have formed a rich sauce.</li>
            <li>Top with the grated cheese, and bake for 15 more minutes, until the cheese has melted. Serve topped with fresh coriander if desired.</li>
        </ol>
