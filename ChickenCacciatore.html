        <h2 class="section-title">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>one whole chicken, cut up, preferably organic</li>
            <li>one clove of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 carrots, finely diced</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>2 or 3 stalks celery, finely diced</li>
            <li>5 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (14 oz or 400g) canned tomato puree (check the Greatest Tomatoes from Europe website for recommended brands)</li>
            <li>few small sprigs of fresh rosemary (or 1 tsp dried)</li>
            <li>6 oz (3/4 c) red or white wine</li>
            <li>2 tsp Kosher or sea salt (more to taste)</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a very large sauté pan or Dutch oven over medium high heat, heat the extra virgin olive oil until hot, then add the chicken pieces (don't remove the skin as it adds flavor.) Sauté for about 5 minutes each side or until it begins to brown. It should not be thoroughly cooked.</li>
            <li>Add the diced onion, garlic, carrot, celery, about 3/4 tsp. of Kosher or sea salt (less if regular) and some ground black pepper. Next, add the rosemary and let cook for about 5 minutes. (If you want to use a crockpot, do so at this point and just add the wine, tomato puree, and a cup of water or chicken broth, and set it to low.)</li>
            <li>When the vegetables are nicely colored, add the wine and let it evaporate.</li>
            <li>Once the wine has evaporated, add the tomato puree. Stir well and allow to simmer gently (covered) for at least 30 minutes or until the chicken is tender and the vegetables are almost a soft sauce. If the chicken starts to dry out, add some water or chicken broth. (I let mine cook closer to an hour, and no liquid was necessary.) Taste for salt and pepper and add if needed.</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, garnish with chopped parsley on its own or with a salad afterwards.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="section-title">Notes</h2>
        <p>This recipe can easily be cooked in a slow cooker or Instant Pot after sautéing on the cooktop.</p>
