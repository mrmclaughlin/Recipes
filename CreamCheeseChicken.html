        <h1 class="recipe-title">Easy Cream Cheese Chicken</h1>
        <p>A cream cheese chicken and mushroom mixture in a large pan with a wooden spoon resting in it. Easy cream cheese chicken is just a few simple ingredients and simple to make, with a deliciously creamy sauce that coats every piece. Ready in less than 30 minutes!</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Prep Time</h2>

        <h2 class="section-title">Total Time</h2>
        <p>30 minutes</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>8 oz. white button mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut in strips</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>4 oz. regular or reduced-fat plain cream cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>1/4 to 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add oil.</li>
            <li>Add onions and mushrooms and sauté for 4-5 minutes. Add garlic and sauté for another 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, slice the chicken into strips and season with the salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat to medium high, then add the seasoned chicken strips to the pan. Sear for 6-8 minutes, turning once, until the chicken strips are golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add the cream cheese and chicken broth and stir until the cream cheese is melted and well incorporated. Sprinkle the mozzarella over the entire pan, then cover, reduce heat and cook another 2-3 minutes, our until chicken is cooked through. (It should reach 165 if you are using a meat thermometer.) Season to taste with extra salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Serve the chicken and mushrooms over steamed rice, with parsley if desired.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="section-title">Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Mushrooms: I love the mushrooms in with this recipe but you could skip them if you don’t have any on hand - or don’t like them. I’ve made this without mushrooms before and it was still delicious.</li>
            <li>Cream cheese: I use the 1/3-less fat cream cheese and it’s deliciously creamy. Go for the real deal if you prefer, but I don’t recommend using fat free cream cheese.</li>
            <li>Broth: If you don’t have any chicken broth, you could substitute vegetable broth or just use water.</li>
            <li>Cheese: I love the melty mozzarella on top but you could also try this served with grated Parmesan if you prefer.</li>
            <li>Herbs: The parsley is good as a garnish but adds a nice herby freshness too. Feel free to skip it or to use some dried herbs as a seasoning on the chicken if you’d like.</li>
            <li>Serving: This is great over steamed brown or white rice, but you could also use quinoa, polenta or mashed potatoes. Steamed broccoli, peas and roasted veggies are all great vegetable sides with this dish.</li>
            <li>Leftovers: This keeps in the fridge for 4-5 days. Reheat leftovers in the microwave (it helps to slice up the chicken into bite size pieces first so they reheat evenly).</li>
        </ul>
