        <h2 class="section-title">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Pieces Cube Steak or thinly cut round steak.</li>
            <li>1 ½ Cups 1:1 Gluten-free Flour Blend (I use King Arthur 1:1).</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons Cornstarch (You can also use arrowroot or potato starch).</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>½ Teaspoon Onion Powder</li>
            <li>½ Teaspoon Sage</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon Pepper</li>
            <li>2 Cups Buttermilk (If you don't have buttermilk, you can make your own just mix two cups of milk with about one and a half tablespoons of vinegar and let it rest a few minutes before adding the egg. You can also use a can of coconut milk with a bit of vinegar to make this dairy-free chicken fried steak).</li>
            <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
            <li>Oil for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">For the gluten-free white gravy.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Tablespoons Butter (For dairy-free gravy use a light cooking oil like avocado oil).</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons Cornstarch or arrowroot starch.</li>
            <li>2½ Cups Milk or a dairy-free alternative like coconut milk.</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>1½ Teaspoons Pepper</li>
            <li>½ Teaspoon Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>½ Tespoon Sage</li>
            <li>½ Cup Ground Sausage (Optional, but make sure you are using a gluten-free sausage).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the dry ingredients together. In a shallow dish combine the flour, cornstarch, garlic, onion, sage, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Mix the wet ingredients together. In a separate shallow dish combine the buttermilk and eggs and whisk them together.</li>
            <li>Bread the cube steaks. Take the cube steaks and dredge them into the dish with the dry ingredients. Then dredge the floured cube steak into the buttermilk mixture. Place the cube steak back into the flour mixture and make sure that no wet spots remain visible. Repeat the steps and take the coated back into the buttermilk and then the flour if you want a thicker breading on your chicken fried steak.</li>
            <li>Let the coated cube steaks rest while you heat the oil and start the gravy.</li>
            <li>Fry the chicken fried steak. Heat about 1- 1½ inches of light cooking oil in a skillet till it reaches about 375 degrees. You do not need to fully submerge the pieces of steak. Carefully place a piece of the coated cube steaks into the oil. Let the cube steak cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until the breading becomes golden. Once the breading has started to crisp up and turn golden, carefully flip the piece of steak over and repeat on the other side. Repeat with the remaining pieces of cube steak. Place the cooked pieces of chicken fried steak onto a plate lined with paper towels, to help remove any excess oil.</li>
            <li>Make the gluten-free country gravy. In a small sauté pan, brown the sausage. (If you are making this country gravy without the sausage, skip this step.) Once the sausage is cooked, remove it from the pan and set it aside. In the same pan, add the butter and let it melt. Once the butter has melted, add the cornstarch and whisk until a paste is formed. Slowly whisk in the milk until it's all combined. Add the spices to the gravy. Stir the cooked sausage back into the gravy and let it thicken to your liking.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="section-title">Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Dry your steaks well.</li>
            <li>Coat the cube steaks starting and ending with the flour.</li>
            <li>Let the breading rest and dry on the cube steak before frying.</li>
            <li>Do NOT use a nonstick pan to fry the chicken fried steak. You want a heavy bottom skillet or cast iron.</li>
            <li>Use the right amount of oil. You do not need any more than about an inch of oil to cook chicken fried steak.</li>
            <li>Your oil temperature should be about 375 degrees for cooking chicken fried steak.</li>
            <li>Spoon hot oil over the steaks to help the breading cook more evenly and help it stick to the steak before flipping it.</li>
            <li>Rest the chicken fried steak on a plate with paper towels to help remove excess oil.</li>
        </ul>
