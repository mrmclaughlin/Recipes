    <h2 class="section-title">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>32 ounces frozen hashbrowns, thawed</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>10.25 ounce can cream of chicken soup</li>
        <li>16 ounces sour cream, full fat</li>
        <li>½ cup finely chopped yellow onion (about 1 small onion)</li>
        <li>8 ounces cheddar cheese, shredded (about 2 cups)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, stir together all of the ingredients until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Pour into prepared baking dish and bake until golden brown and bubbling, 30 to 45 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley or chives, if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="section-title">Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Frozen Shredded Hashbrowns – The hash browns should be thawed before using so that the dish bakes evenly. You can also use the diced hashbrowns if you’d like. I do not recommend using fresh potatoes, as there would be too much excess moisture.</li>
        <li>Cream of Chicken Soup – You can also substitute cream of mushroom soup.</li>
        <li>Sour Cream – You can substitute full-fat, plain Greek yogurt.</li>
        <li>Cheddar Cheese – The classic pick for this type of casserole and you can use sharp cheddar cheese or mild, but you can also use other cheese varieties, too. Other good options are mozzarella, gouda, Montery Jack, and Colby cheese.</li>
        <li>Turn it into Funeral Potatoes – Simply add a topping of crushed cornflakes or Ritz crackers for extra taste and texture.</li>
        <li>Spice it up – Stir in a 4-ounce can of green chiles to give this casserole a kick and southwest flavor.</li>
        <li>Make-Ahead - You can assemble this casserole in the baking dish, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to 2 days before baking.</li>
        <li>Storage - Once the casserole is baked and cooled, store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.</li>
        <li>You can freeze the hashbrown casserole, either before baking it or after it has been baked and cooled. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and foil and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before baking or reheating in the oven.</li>
        <li>Nutritional values are based on one serving.</li>
    </ul>
