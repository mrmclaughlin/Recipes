        <h3>Chickpea Patties Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>30 ounces chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed (2 cans)</li>
            <li>1/2 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup plain dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lime zest</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Chipotle Avocado Cream Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large avocado</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons lime juice</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sour cream</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon chipotle powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all ingredients for chickpea patties, except for flour, oil, and lime zest, in a food processor and process. You don't want it totally smooth. You want to be able to roll into a ball but texture is good.</li>
            <li>Using about 1/4 cup of the mixture, roll into a ball and then gently press the ball into a patty. Repeat with remaining mixture. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the chipotle avocado cream sauce by combining all ingredients together in a food processor and processing until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
            <li>After the patties have chilled, use enough oil to lightly coat the bottom of a skillet and heat over medium-high heat. Dredge the patties in flour and fry until golden brown, 4 - 5 minutes per side. You may need to do this in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Remove from oil, sprinkle with salt and lime zest. Serve with chipotle avocado cream sauce.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="note"><strong>Notes:</strong> Don't skip refrigerating the patties, it helps them stay together better when you're cooking them. The sauce can be made ahead of time and refrigerated until ready to use.</p>
