        <p>This homemade red enchilada sauce has authentic Mexican flavor! It’s so good and easy, you’ll never go back to store-bought sauce again. You can even make a double batch and freeze half of it for later. Recipe as written below yields about 2 cups (16 ounces) sauce.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>9 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>9 tablespoon flour (whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour and gluten-free flour blends all work!)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon ground chili powder (scale back if you’re sensitive to spice or using particularly spicy chili powder)</li>
            <li>3 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Pinch of cinnamon (optional but recommended)</li>
            <li>6 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>6 cup vegetable broth</li>
            <li>3 teaspoon apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>This sauce comes together quickly once you get started, so measure the dry ingredients (the flour, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, salt, and optional cinnamon) into a small bowl and place it near the stove. Place the tomato paste and broth near the stove as well.</li>
            <li>In a medium-sized pot over medium heat, warm the oil until it’s hot enough that a light sprinkle of the flour/spice mixture sizzles on contact. This might take a couple of minutes, so be patient and don’t step away from the stove!</li>
            <li>Once it’s ready, pour in the flour and spice mixture. While whisking constantly, cook until fragrant and slightly deepened in color, about 1 minute. Whisk the tomato paste into the mixture, then slowly pour in the broth while whisking constantly to remove any lumps.</li>
            <li>Raise heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, whisking often, for about 5 to 7 minutes, until the sauce has thickened a bit and a spoon encounters some resistance as you stir it. (The sauce will thicken some more as it cools.)</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, then whisk in the vinegar and season to taste with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Add more salt, if necessary (I usually add another pinch or two). Go forth and make enchiladas!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="section-title">Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Enchilada sauce recipe adapted from my spinach artichoke enchiladas.</li>
            <li>STORAGE SUGGESTIONS: Extra enchilada sauce will keep well in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Or, freeze it for up to 3 months. Let it cool to room temperature before transferring to a wide-mouth mason jar, leaving some room at the top for expansion (don’t screw on the lid completely until the mixture is fully frozen), or a freezer bag (remove excess air before sealing).</li>
            <li>MAKE IT GLUTEN FREE: Just use gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. I tried with Bob’s Red Mill brand and it worked great.</li>
            <li>MAKE IT TOMATO FREE: You can omit the tomato paste. You might want to up the spices a bit. The sauce won’t taste quite like the enchilada sauce you might buy at the store, but it will still be good!</li>
            <li>CHANGE IT UP: The chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder are essential here, but feel free to change up the other spices to suit your preferences.</li>
        </ul>
