            <li>2 (14-ounce) cans black beans, drained, rinsed, and patted dry</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (100g) finely chopped bell pepper (1/2 of a pepper)</li>
            <li>1 cup (130g) finely chopped yellow onion (1/2 of a large onion)</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced (about 1 Tablespoon)</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (60g) bread crumbs or oat flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (70g) feta cheese (skip if vegan)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs (see note for vegan substitution)</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Worcestershire sauce (see note for vegan & vegetarian version)</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons ketchup, mayo, or BBQ sauce</li>
            <li>Pinch salt + pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Spread beans evenly onto a lined baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes until slightly dried out.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, sauté olive oil, chopped pepper, onion, and garlic over medium heat until peppers and onions are soft, about 5-6 minutes. Gently blot some of the moisture out. Place in a large bowl or in a food processor with the remaining ingredients. Stir or pulse everything together, then add the black beans. Mash with a fork or pulse the mixture, leaving some larger chunks of beans.</li>
            <li>Form into patties, about 1/2 cup (130g) of mixture each, about 3/4-inch thick.</li>
            <li>To bake: Place patties on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and bake at 375°F (191°C) for 10 minutes on each side. To grill: Place patties on greased aluminum foil and grill 8 minutes on each side.</li>
            <li>Serve with your favorite toppings. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
