            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat with nonstick spray.</li>
                <li>Place potatoes in a single layer onto the prepared baking sheet. Add olive oil; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Gently toss to combine.</li>
                <li>Place into oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until golden brown, stirring halfway. Set aside and keep warm.</li>
                <li>Season chicken thighs with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Working in batches, add chicken, skin-side down, and sear both sides until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side; set aside. Drain excess fat, reserving 2 tablespoons in the Dutch oven.</li>
                <li>Add shallot, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3-5 minutes. Stir in garlic and oregano until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Stir in chicken stock and wine, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the Dutch oven. Return chicken to the skillet.</li>
                <li>Place into oven and bake until chicken has completely cooked through, reaching an internal temperature of 175 degrees F, about 12-15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in peas and lemon juice until heated through, about 1 minute; season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately with potatoes, garnished with parsley, if desired.</li>
            </ol>
