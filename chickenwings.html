    <h2 class="section-title">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds chicken wings, halved at joints, wingtips discarded</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons baking powder* (aluminum free)</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>Buffalo sauce:</li>
        <li>1/3 cup Frank's Wings Hot Sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon water</li>
        <li>Other Sauce ideas: honey BBQ sauce, ranch, honey garlic sauce, BBQ sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Adjust your oven rack to the upper-middle position. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a wire rack (such as a cooling rack) on top. Spray the rack with non-stick spray.</li>
        <li>Use paper towels to pat the wings dry and place them in a large bowl. It's important to dry them REALLY well!</li>
        <li>Combine the salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and baking powder in a small bowl. Then sprinkle the seasoning over the wings, tossing to evenly coat.</li>
        <li>Arrange wings, skin side up, in single layer on prepared wire rack.</li>
        <li>Bake on the upper middle oven rack, turning every 20 minutes until wings are crispy and browned. The total cook time will depend on the size of the wings but may take up to 1 hour. Temp of wings should be 185</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and let stand for 5 minutes. Transfer wings to bowl and toss with sauce.</li>
       <li>For an extra Flavor edge --- Grill wings using a medium high heat on each side till slightly chared. Recoat with basting brush with your wing sauce.</li>
        <li>For Buffalo sauce: In a medium saucepan over medium heat stir together all sauce ingredients. Mix well until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature before adding to wings (or prepare the sauce ahead of time and refrigerate).</li>
       
    </ol>

    <h2 class="section-title">Notes</h2>
    <p>Baking Powder: You MUST use aluminum-free baking POWDER (not baking soda) for this recipe. I recommend Rumford brand.</p>
   <p> You can make the wings the day before and then coat them in the sauce the next day and grill following the grill instructions.</p>
