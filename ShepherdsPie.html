        <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
        <h3 class="subsection-title">How to Make Potatoes:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chopped potatoes in a large saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to boil. Cook until potatoes are tender (12-15 minutes), don’t overcook potatoes. Drain and mash potatoes in the same pot.</li>
            <li>Add warm cream and 1/2 tsp salt (or to taste) then mash until smooth. Lastly, mash in the parmesan cheese and beaten egg.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">How to Make the Filling:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400˚F with a rack in the center. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 1 Tbsp olive oil and ground beef. Breaking up the beef with a spatula then season with 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper and cook until meat is just cooked through and no longer pink (5 minutes).</li>
            <li>Add onions and sauté for 3 minutes to soften then add minced garlic and stir another minute.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with 2 Tbsp flour and stir for 1 minute. You’ll see a film form on the bottom of your pan.</li>
            <li>Stir in red wine, scraping the bottom to deglaze the pan for a minute. Add beef broth, 1 Tbsp tomato paste, and 1 Tbsp Worcestershire.</li>
            <li>Add 1 1/2 cups of frozen veggies and bring to a light boil. Season with another 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper or add to taste. Reduce heat to a simmer, cover and cook 10 minutes until sauce is slightly thickened.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">How to Assemble Shepherd’s Pie:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Transfer meat and veggie mixture to a deep pie dish, or 11x7 or 9x9 casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Scoop mashed potatoes over the top then spread evenly, making sure to seal the potatoes to the edge of the dish so the filling doesn’t bubble up.</li>
            <li>Drizzle 2 Tbsp melted butter over the top. Place a sheet of foil under the casserole to catch any drips and bake at 400˚F on the center rack for 25-30 minutes or until potatoes start to turn golden. Cool 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
