    <h2 class="section-title">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Butter</li>
        <li>0.25 cup + 2 Tablespoons Flour</li>
        <li>1 cups Chicken Broth</li>
        <li>0.5 chicken bouillon cube or 1 teaspoon Better Than Bouillon (Optional- see notes.)</li>
        <li>0.5 cup milk, preferably whole but any kind works</li>
        <li>0.17 teaspoon celery salt</li>
        <li>0.17 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>0.17 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>0.17 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>0.17 teaspoon pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Note: It’s important to whisk continuously throughout this process to ensure the smoothest possible consistency.</li>
        <li>Temper the milk by microwaving it for 45 seconds. This prevents curdling but also prevents lumps from forming when it’s added. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Let it fully melt and wait until it starts to foam, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the flour, whisk continuously for 3-5 minutes, until it’s the consistency of wet sand. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Add 1/3 of the chicken broth and whisk well. Add 1/3 more, whisk well.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining chicken broth, chicken bouillon, warm milk, and seasonings, whisk continuously.</li>
        <li>Return to heat and bring to a near boil. Continue to whisk until it begins to get very thick. Immediately remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Soup will continue to thicken upon standing.</li>
        <li>If possible, run the mixture through a fine mesh strainer for a super-smooth consistency.</li>
        <li>Use as a direct substitute for condensed cream of chicken soup, this recipe makes enough for two (10.5 oz.) cans.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="section-title">Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding chicken bouillon to the mix helps match the concentrated chicken flavor found in condensed soups. This is especially helpful if store-bought chicken broth (such as Swanson), is used instead of homemade chicken stock.</li>
        <li>Reducing Sodium: You can use unsalted butter and reduced sodium chicken broth and bouillon to lower the salt content. You can also refrain from adding salt as a seasoning.</li>
        <li>Storage: Refrigerate for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 4 months. The mixture may separate slightly once reheated but whisking will correct that. I recommend storing these in freezable soup containers. This soup cannot be canned as it contains dairy.</li>
        <li>Be sure to try my homemade condensed cream of mushroom soup next!</li>
    </ul>
